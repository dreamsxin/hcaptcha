## What is Captcha

CAPTCHA is an acronym for 
"Completely Automatic Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart".
It is a task, that human can easily solve, but computer not.

It is used as a challenge-response to ensure that the individual submitting 
information is a human and not an automated process. Typically, a captcha is 
used with form submissions where authenticated users are not necessary, 
but you want to prevent spam submissions.
